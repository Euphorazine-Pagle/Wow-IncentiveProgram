World of Warcraft - Incentive Program - Satchel Finder
<h2 id="w-incentive-program-satchel-finder">Incentive Program - Satchel Finder</h2>
<p>Incentive Program is an AddOn that will look through all of the Dungeon and Raid finder to find the Call to Arms bonus loot for you. When new satchels of loot are found, it will add the dungeon to the frame where you can click from there to join.</p>
<p>The addon is able to identify new instances, which helps future proof the addon without a need for immediate updates.</p>
<p>The addon adds flair to the LFR Raid instances, to help identify which wing of the instance for which you are queuing.</p>
<h3 id="w-how-to-use">How to Use</h3>
<p><strong>Left Click</strong> the small frame to view eligible instances that have the incentive. If you do not like a particular instance, you can ignore the entire instance or just certain roles for that instance. You can join from the left click menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Holding Shift</strong> when clicking the menu or mousing over the dungeon choices will show the missing instances so you can adjust settings, even when there are no incentives</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Right Click</strong> the button to view the options where you can set the roles you want to play, clear previously ignored instances, and adjust settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can set roles, even those not eligible for your class if you want to search for an alt instead of the character you are currently playing on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can hide the normal frame to use with a Data Broker addon. The alert will have the frame cycle through images to grab your attention, as well as play the LFG Tool ping sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The toast will create a pop up that can be clicked to join the dungeon's queue. This frame is draggable.</p>
